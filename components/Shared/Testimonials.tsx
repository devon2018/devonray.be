Based on our requirements and designs, he met our expectations and successfully completed the project. During development and testing, he proved very collaborative in trying to resolve issues be it technical or design related and offered practical compromises. We were happy with the final delivery and used him once again to add a feature to the app in early 2021. Outside of the project, Devon has been amenable to offering support, which has been greatly appreciated."
